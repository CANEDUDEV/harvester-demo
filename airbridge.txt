From paired state:

1. Master unpair from slave: DIC=0xCAD0 with  RF ID = 0
2. Master initiate pairing: DID=0xCAD1 with Activate = 1
3. Detected slave's ID (0x090101) will be reported at DID=0xAED1 (last 3 bytes)
4. Master pair to slave: DID=0xCAD2 with slave ID as last 3 bytes.

OR
1. Unpair
2. Skip 2 and 3 above, use 0xCAD0 to pair with slave ID directly.

Always unpair at startup.

Trigger steps 2-4 from IO board on switch press or depress.

- How to disable Car RC when paired? When should it be enabled again? Which faults can occur, how do we handle them?

- How do 3 air bridges work together when pairing/unpairing?

Feedback to Kvaser:
- Both 0xCAD0 and 0xCAD2 have unpair option in management interface docs, but only 0xCAD0 works for unpairing.
